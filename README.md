# Why kids should learn python
The reasons I believe kids should learn Python are best described when compared to another language that is commonly taught to children.  Therefore, I will argue why Python would be better to teach children rather than HTML.

## 1.  Python is an object oriented language where HTML is a declarative language.
When teaching kids HTML, you are showing them how to build a static page, i.e., there is no interaction without the aid of JavaScript.  Once their website is done, most kids will not go back to the language at all.  However, with python being object oriented, it is dynamic.  Without going into what object oriented programming (OOP) is in too much detail, it is about modeling the world around you.  With OOP, kids will be more readily able to resolve real world problems.  The kids will be able to make dynamic programs that take input, do some calculation, and provide output.  That will be interactive and once their program to accomplish task A is complete, they can create another quick program to accomplish task B or even build off of what they created previously.

## 2.  Python is quick and easy
I am not saying that HTML is not easy or not quick, but with Python, it comes more naturally to read to people.  If you can read, you can generally figure out how a program flows.  Whitespace is important in python and it makes the program much easier to read.  In addition, there is not much declaration that is required to get a python program to work as there is with a HTML program.  For example, if we wanted to write something to the display we can compare Python and HTML below:

  HTML5:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE HTML>
      <HEAD>
      </HEAD>
      <BODY>
            <h1>
                "Hello World!"
            </h1>
      </BODY>
  </HTML>
  ```
  Python3.4:
  ```python
  print("Hello World!")
  ```
  Python 2.7:
  ```python
  print("Hello World!")
  ```
## 3.  It builds the foundation for STEM majors.
A lot of STEM majors rely on some sort of object oriented programming to advance their research and knowledge on a topic.  Learning the basics of a language that is commonly used in STEM majors will provide the children a chance to be ahead of other children entering the same degree program without that knowledge.  Using a OOP based language would be second nature to them.  Using a declarative language like HTML will not provide the opportunities for problem solving like that of an Object-oriented language like Python.

## 4.  It is an open source cross-platform language
Again, without going into the details of what open source is, the important thing to note here is that there are low barriers to entry.  That means that in order to get a functional program that can be shared with others, all the person needs on their machine is an interpreter for Python which is freely available.  Comparing this to other OOP languages, some have higher barriers to entry like that of C# (**don't ever** consider this one for children).  C# requires a Microsoft based platform in addition to the Visual Studio compiler.

## 5.  What about online?  Isn't everything moving that way anyways?
Yes.  It is true that when it comes to online languages, HTML would win out in this one, but, by using Django, you can achieve online functionality with Python.  Using this framework is by no means as simply as HTML but it can be done and as long as the children have a good foundation of Python, they can move towards online programming in the future without leaving the language.
